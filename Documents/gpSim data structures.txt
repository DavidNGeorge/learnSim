Network:	general properties of the network
	.actIn			activation across the input layer
	.actOut			activation across the output layer
	.alpha			matrix of effectiveness values for each stimulus
	.alphaLinear		flag indicating whether alpha value changes are uniform across range of values, or use a formula based on the term (alpha – alphaMin)(alphaMax – alpha)
	.alphaMax		maximum effectiveness value
	.alphaMin		minimum effectiveness value

	.dParam			generalization parameter
	.E			matrix of values giving associative strength of each CU
	.intensity		matrix of values giving intensity of each stimulus
	.nConfigs		number of configural units
	.nStimuli		number of stimuli (ie input units)
	.recruit		lag indicating whether new CUs should be recruited as the ability of stimuli to activate a CU changes
	.recruitThreshold	activity level in maximally activate CU below which a new CU will be recruited
	.sigma			matrix of associability for each CU
