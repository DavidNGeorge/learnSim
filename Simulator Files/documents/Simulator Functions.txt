%simGetExptData Simulator get experiment data
%   [A, B, C, D, E, F, G] = getexptdata(X, Y) reads a number of data
%   files and returns information to run simulations of associative 
%   learning models.  X = list of full path file names to read; Z = associative 
%   learning model being simulated; Z = parameter available for some simulators 
%   to use. data for model returned in [A, B, C,....]. The last variable 
%   returned is an error flag. sigma included for future expansion. 

%simGetFileList Simulator get file list
%   [A, B] = simGetFileList(X, Y, Z) returns a list of data files that are
%   required by the simulator model specified in Y, and a vector indicating
%   whether each file exists in folder X. Z is a simulator specific
%   parameter.

%simGetOrder Simulator Get Order
%   A = simGetOrder(N, K) returns a vector that contains a random
%   permutation of the numbers 1 to K if N equals 1, or else the numbers
%   1 to K in order if N does not equal 1.
%
%   simGetOrder calls randperm which in turn calls RAND and therefore 
%   changes the state of the random number generator that underlies RAND, 
%   RANDI, and RANDN.  Control that shared generator using RNG.

%simNameTrials Simulator name trials
%   [A] = simNameTrials(X) returns a list of the patterns specified in
%   matrix [X].

%simPatterns Simulator patterns
%   [A, B, C] = simPatterns(X, Y, Z) returns matrices containing [A]: the
%   definition of all unique patterns contained in the matrix [X]; [B]: the
%   activity at the input layer of the input network of Pearce's configural
%   theory for each of those patterns; [C] the activity at the output layer
%   of the input network for each of those patterns. Activity at the input
%   layer is dependent upon [Z]. If an exisiting pattern matrix is passed
%   to [Y], then it will be preserved in [A].

%lsimRemActs REM simulator define patterns and active populations
%   [A, B] = lsimRemActs(X) returns all possible patterns that REM could be 
%   exposed to in A and the active representational populations for each of
%   those patterns in B based on population matrix X


%lsimRemPops REM simulator define populations and activity
%   [A, B] = lsimRemPops(X) returns all non-void trinary patterns of 
%   n_stim bits to A and activity in each population to B where n_stim is 
%   the number of columns in the r value matrix X

%lsimReoder reorders a matrix
%   [A] = lsimReorder(X) returns a matrix sorted first by the sum of each
%   row and then by each column in turn. Useful for reordering a list of
%   trial types defined by ones and zeros used in learning simulators so
%   that they appear in a convential order (e.g. A, B, C, AB, AC, BC, ABC)

%simTrials Simulator trials
%   A = simTrials(X, Y) returns a vector of the same length as X, where
%   each element corresponds to the index of the row in Y which is the same
%   as the appropriate row in X. That is, the function enumerates the rows
%   of X with respect to the rows of Y.
