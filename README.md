# learnSim
MATLAB programmes for the simulation of associative learning models.

Implemented models: Rescorla and Wagner (1972) model with configurational units (Wagner & Rescorla, 1972); Pearce's (1994) configural theory (with modification suggested by Kinder & Lachnit, 2003); Wagner's (2003) replaced elements model (REM); a context-dependent added elements model (C-AEM; George, unpublished)
